In order to run this above code the following steps need to be run

  1. Create a new EV3 Project in Vscode
  2. Copy main.py, onshapeCommunication.py, and api-key into the VsCode Project
  3. Edit the api-key file and replace the first two lines with the access key and secret key respectively
  4. Download and Run the code to the EV3 using F5

The code operates by waiting for the user to press any button on the EV3 in order to detect a color. This color is then sent to Onshape's API from an outside Python script.
